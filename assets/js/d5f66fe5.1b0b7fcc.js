Therefore, the maker can introduce a threshold in the number of tokens exchanged in the atomic swap, under which any request of exchange would be rejected. If the parameter is set equal to valueA, it means that the maker intends to perform a single atomic swap and exchange the entire amount of tokenA. If the parameter is different, it represents an arbitrary value equal to or below half of the valueA, which indicates the minimum amount accepted for every single swap with other users. The lower the parameter is set, the higher the chances to find a match, but fees and dust increase. On the other hand, if the parameter is high, failure is probable in finalizing the order (i.e., only a few orders find a match and execute as atomic swaps)."]}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"priceRange"}),": indicates the deviation from the actual price in the offer that might be accepted by the maker.
