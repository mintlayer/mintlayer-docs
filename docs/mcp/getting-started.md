# Mintlayer MCP

Mintlayer provides a hosted MCP endpoint at:

`https://mojito-api.mintlayer.org/mcp`

Use this endpoint in any MCP-compatible client to let your assistant interact with Mintlayer services.

## Quick setup

1. Open your MCP-compatible client settings.
2. Add a new remote MCP server.
3. Set the server URL to `https://mojito-api.mintlayer.org/mcp`.
4. Save, reconnect, and verify the server is available.

## Example prompts

After connecting the server, you can try prompts like:

- "List available Mintlayer tools."
- "Show me Mintlayer network information."
- "Help me prepare a transaction flow for Mintlayer."

## Notes

- This is a hosted endpoint, so no local MCP server process is required.
- Tool availability depends on your MCP client and current server capabilities.
